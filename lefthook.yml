      # NOTE: there's one caveat with this hook! When pushing, it will only correctly scan the range of
      # outgoing commits when pushing to a matching branch on the remote (e.g. `git push`) - pushing to a
      # different ref on the remote like `git push origin master:foreign` does not work..
      #
      # For this to work the following issue will need to be fixed (in short: Lefthook does not pass on stdin
      # to the hook script, whereas pre-push is one of the few hooks which retrieves information from there):
      # https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/issues/1471
      #
      # The hook configuration would then turn into:
      #
      # pre-push:
      #   scripts:
      #     secrets-audit:
      #       runner: sh
      #
      # with a file .lefthook/pre-push/secrets-audit looking something like:
      #
      # while read -r local_ref local_sha remote_ref remote_sha; do
      #   echo "$local_ref $local_sha $remote_ref $remote_sha" | talisman --githook pre-push
